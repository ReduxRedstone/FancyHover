# FancyHover
CSS hover events based on the hover events found on http://daneden.github.io/Toast/

This class is based on the hover events made by Daniel Eden on the demo page of his Toast class. Since nothing was posted on his GitHub about it, I scraped the css and broke it all down to just the barebones of the hover. Class name and layout has been edited to now be called `fancyhover` and takes the arbitrary attribute called `hover` instead of `class`. I have also added a reverse version for making the hover on the underside.

##Usage:
Top -
```html
<p class="fancyhover fancyhover-top" hovertext="This is an example of some fancy hover text">Fancy hover text top</p>
```
Bottom -
```html
<p class="fancyhover fancyhover-bottom" hovertext="This is an example of some fancy hover text">Fancy hover text bottom</p>
```
